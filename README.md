## Description

This is an application that generates a random password based on the criteria selected by the user in the prompts. The application runs in the browser and features basic HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. The password can also be copied to the users clipboard by clicking on the copy password button. Lastly, the user interface is clean, polished, responsive, and adapts to multiple screen sizes.
